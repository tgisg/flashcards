1) How will you know when the problem is solved? (Identify the big-picture goal)
2) How do you want to use the software? (Indentify the "interface")
3) What's the (next-)most trivial possible case? (Indentify the next small-picture goal)
4) How do we achieve this goal? (Sketch an algorithm using pseudocode)
5) Implement it (do programming)
6) Is the whole problem (from step 1) solved? If not, return to 3.
